# Step 1: Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Step 2: Update main branch
git pull origin main

# Step 3: Merge feature branch into main
git merge feature-branch

# Step 4: Resolve any conflicts (if there are conflicts)
# Edit conflicting files to resolve conflicts, then mark them as resolved
git add <file-with-conflict>

# Step 5: Complete the merge (only necessary if there were conflicts)
git commit

Note: If there were no conflicts, the git merge command in step 3 would have completed the merge and created a commit automatically.

# Step 6: Push the updated main branch to the remote repository
git push origin main
